GOG Tropico with dxwrapper, tropico edit and .evt files required to fix the doubled hotel income bug.

Dxwrapper should be installed and working without any intervension.

Tropico edit and the hotel fix can be found in the extras folder present in the root of the wine prefix.

tropico-auto-scenario-fix.sh is a script for fixing all the premade scenarios post intall.

tropico-auto-hotel-fix.sh is a script that watches Tropico's "game" folder for new saves with the prefix "s-" (s for scenario) and automatically applys the hotel fix. You'll find the patched scenario in the premade scenario list.
